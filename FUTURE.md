# Future Version of Wubble QuickTune AI Roadmap.
* This document outlines the planned features and enhancements for the Wubble QuickTune project. Our goal is to evolve this prototype into a robust, personalized, and truly AI driven music generation platform. The roadmap is divided into key areas of development.

# ðŸš€ Phase 1: Foundational Enhancements & Core Experiences.
These are the immediate next steps to solidify the current application and prepare it for more advanced features.
## 1. Robust User Authentication & Session Persistence

**Problem:**
  * User sessions are currently not persistent across page reloads, leading to a fragmented experience. This is major problem in the website.

**Solution:**
  * Implement a persistent authentication flow using server side sessions or JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user signs in with Google, a token will be generated and stored securely (httpOnly cookie), allowing the session to persist.
  * Expand authentication options to include Email/Password and other OAuth providers like GitHub.

## 2. Cloud Synced Favorites & User Data.
**Problem:**
  * "Liked" songs are stored only in localStorage, which is device specific and can be cleared.

**Solution:**
  * Migrate user specific data (liked songs, generation history) from localStorage to a database (e.g: PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
  * Each user's favorites and history will be tied to their account, making them accessible from any device upon login.

## 3. Dedicated Backend API for Audio.

**Problem:**
  * Audio files are currently served statically from the /public/audio folder and a tracks.json file. This is not scalable or dynamic. But this is ok for assignment work scale but for real time project scale, This is not good.

**Solution:**
  * Develop a dedicated backend API endpoint (e.g: GET /api/v1/tracks) that handles the logic for selecting and serving tracks based on user selected mood and genre.
  * Move audio files to a dedicated object storage solution like AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 for better performance, scalability, and management.

# ðŸ§  Phase 2: True AI Integration & Expanded Creativity.

This phase focuses on realizing the core AI Music promise of the application.

## 1. Transition to a Genuine AI Music Generation Model.

**Goal:**
  * Move from a curated list of static tracks to dynamic, on demand AI generated music.

**Implementation Strategy:**
  * Hybrid Model: To build user trust and ensure quality, we will initially present a mix of results for each generation request:
      * 2 Human Created Tracks: High quality, professionally produced tracks that match the user's query.
      *  2 AI Generated Tracks: Tracks generated in real time by an integrated AI music model.
  * Backend Integration: The backend will be responsible for orchestrating this. It will fetch human tracks from the database and simultaneously make a call to a generative AI service or model.
  * Asynchronous Generation: Since AI generation can take time, we will implement a job queue system (e.g: using Redis and BullMQ). The user will see a "Generating your music..." state and be notified via WebSockets or polling when the tracks are ready.
  * Yes again we need a lot of human work for creating human created tracks. But until our AI full trained test. I think this way is good. Becuase if customer is do not like generated 2 tracks, Then he/she can download human generated tracks. This will hold our customers for a peroid of time.

## 2. Expanded Customization Parameters.
**Goal:**
  * Give users finer control over the music generation process.

**New Filters:**
  *  We will add more creative controls beyond just Mood and Genre, such as:
    * Instrumentation: (e.g: Piano, Synth, Acoustic Guitar, Strings)
    * BPM (Beats Per Minute): A slider to control the tempo.
    * Track Duration: (e.g: 30s, 60s, 90s). Free plan has limited duration of tracks and paid plan has longer duration.
    * Musical Key: (e.g: C Major, A Minor)

# âœ¨ Phase 3: Personalization & Platform Growth.

With the core technology in place, we will focus on creating a highly personalized and engaging user experience.

## 1. Personalized "For You" Engine. 
**Goal:** 
  * Proactively suggest music and generation ideas tailored to the individual user.

**Implementation:**
  * Analyze a user's listening history, liked tracks, and most frequently used generation parameters (moods, genres, etc.).
  * Create a "For You" or "Discover" section on the dashboard that recommends new combinations or features pre generated tracks based on their taste profile. This moves beyond simple history to intelligent recommendation.

## 2. Project & Collection Management.
**Goal:**
  * Allow users to organize their creations for different purposes.

**Features:** 
  * Users can create named "Projects" or "Collections" (e.g: "Podcast Intro Music," "Focus Playlist").
  * They can save their favorite generated tracks into these collections for easy access and bulk download.

## 3. Advanced UI/UX & Social Sharing.
**Goal:**
  * Make the application more visually engaging and shareable.

**Features:**
  * Dynamic Audio Visualizer: Implement a real-time waveform or frequency spectrum visualizer that syncs with the playing audio.
  * Social Sharing: Add a "Share" button that generates a unique link to a specific generated track, allowing others to listen to it. This will include metadata (e.g: "A 'Happy Pop' track generated by Wubble QuickTune").

## 4. Monetization & Pro Features (Long Term Vision).
**Goal:**
  * Introduce a sustainable business model.

**Potential Features:**
  * Pro Subscription: Offer higher quality audio downloads formarts like (WAV, FLAC), longer track generation, access to premium instruments/moods, and unlimited "Projects."
  * Usage-Based Licensing: For commercial use of the generated music.

### ðŸŸ¢ Note: Yes I can improve the website with lot of features, But without a good team and good management. I can not do anything because to grow business and give customer what's he/she needs without a good team and good management is not possible. If we give what customers need then he/she will pay us for our service's then our business will grow. This happens when a good team and good management is there. These are only my ideas but, If I work team. They will also give suggestions and more idea's.
